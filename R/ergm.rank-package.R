#' Fit, Simulate and Diagnose Exponential-Family Models for Rank-Order
#' Relational Data
#'
#' \pkg{ergm.rank} is a set of extensions to package \CRANpkg{ergm} to
#' fit and simulate from exponential-family random graph models for
#' networks whose edge weights are ranks.
#'
#' Mainly, it implements the
#' \code{\link[=CompleteOrder-ergmReference]{CompleteOrder}} reference
#' measure for valued ERGMs \insertCite{Kr12e,KrHu23e}{ergm.rank} and
#' provides some rank-order change statistics
#' (`search.ergmTerms("ordinal")` for a list)
#' \insertCite{KrBu17e}{ergm.rank}.
#'
#' When publishing results obtained using this package, please cite the
#' original authors as described in \code{citation(package="ergm.rank")}.
#'
#' All programs derived from this package must cite it.
#'
#' This package contains functions specific to using [ergm()] to model
#' networks whose dyad values are ranks. Examples include preferences,
#' valued ties reduced to ranks, etc.. These terms have a specialized
#' interpretation, and are therefore generally prefixed by "`rank.`",
#' though they should take any valued data.
#'
#' For detailed information on how to download and install the software, go to
#' the Statnet project website: \url{https://statnet.org}. A tutorial, support
#' newsgroup, references and links to further resources are provided there.
