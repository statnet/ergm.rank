\title{(Weighted) Inconsistency}
\usage{
# valued: rank.inconsistency(x, attrname, weights, wtname, wtcenter)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, attrname}{\code{x} can be a \code{\link[network:network]{network}} with an edge attribute \code{attrname} containing the ranks or a matrix of
appropriate dimension containing the ranks. If \code{x} is not
given, it defaults to the LHS network, and if \code{attrname} is
not given, it defaults to the \code{response} edge attribute.}

\item{weights}{optional parameter to weigh the counts. Can be either a 3D \eqn{n\times n\times n} -array
whose \eqn{(i,j,k)} th element gives the weight for the
comparison by \eqn{i} of \eqn{j} and \eqn{k} or a function taking
three arguments, \eqn{i}, \eqn{j}, and \eqn{k}, and returning
the weight of this comparison.}

\item{wtname, wtcenter}{If \code{wtcenter=TRUE} , the
calculated weights will be centered around their
mean. \code{wtname} can be used to label this term.}
}
\description{
Measures the amount of disagreement between rankings of the focus
network and a fixed covariate network \code{x} , by couting the number of pairwise
comparisons for which the two networks disagree.
