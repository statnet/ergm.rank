\title{Newcomb's Fraternity Networks}
\format{
A list of 15 networks.
}
\source{
\url{https://github.com/bavla/Nets/blob/master/data/Pajek/ucinet/README.md}
}
\description{
These 14 networks record weekly sociometric preference rankings from 17 men
attending the University of Michigan in the fall of 1956; Data were
collected longitudinally over 15 weeks, although data from week 9 are
missing.
}
\details{
The men were recruited to live in off-campus (fraternity) housing, rented
for them as part of the Michigan Group Study Project supervised by Theodore
Newcomb from 1953 to 1956. All were incoming transfer students with no prior
acquaintance of one another.

The data set, derived from one in the unreleased \code{netdata} package,
contains a network list \code{newcomb} with 14 networks. Each network is
complete and contains two edge attributes: \describe{
\item{list("rank")}{the preference of the \eqn{i}th man for the \eqn{j}th
man from \code{1} through \code{16}, with \code{1} being the highest
preference.} \item{list("descrank")}{the same, but \code{1} indicates lowest
preference.} }
